Register the company with a username, eg `test`.
Make sure to add a secure password: eg `test@123`.
Then when the user is registered, then the drone link for the plant becomes : `rtmp://35.188.41.41/live/{{plantname}}`
ie. If the name of the plant is Dahej, Then the drone link for the plant is `rtmp://35.188.41.41/live/test`
